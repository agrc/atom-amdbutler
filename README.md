# AMD Butler Package for Atom [work-in-progress]

Serving up AMD module imports

A Atom Editor package for managing AMD dependency import statements. It helps you quickly sort, add, and remove AMD import statements. With features such as auto sorting and auto module name discovery it allows you to focus more on your code rather than worrying your AMD imports. This is a port of a plugin with the same name for [Sublime Text 3](https://github.com/agrc/AmdButler).
